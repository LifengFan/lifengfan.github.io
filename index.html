		<p> Hello! My Chinese name is èŒƒä¸½å‡¤. I am a research scientist at Cognitive Reasoning Lab,  <a href="https://www.bigai.ai/">Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)</a> now. I pursued my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
			I worked at the <a href="https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/">Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning and Autonomy (VCLA)</a> 
			under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/">Prof. Song-Chun Zhu</a>.
			I received a B.S. in Statistics at Zhejiang University. 
			My research interests include Theory of Mind, cognitive architecture, social scene understanding, human communication dynamics, social interaction and cooperation, etc.
